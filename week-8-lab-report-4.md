1. Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

I think that there not is a small code change that will make my program work because I would have to find the indecies of the backticks and how it relates to the parenthesis it would be pretty much like finding a link.  

2. Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

I think that there is a small code change that will make my program work because I would have to do something along the lines of a while loops for the first bracket to check the farthest bracket if there are consecutive brackets without another closing bracket inbetween.  

3. Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change. 

No need for changes because it already works.
