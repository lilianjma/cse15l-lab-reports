***Describe which implementation is correct***  
Their implementation is correct.  

***Corect output:***  
`[foo(and(bar))]`

***For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3 sentences. You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed (Provide a screenshot of code and highlight where the change needs to be made).***  

The bug is that it finds the first instance of the closed bracket. Something that could fix it for this test file is a while loop after the highlighted line that finds the last instance of a closing bracket as long as the closing brackets are next to each other.

`[(foo)]`

For their MarkdownParser, they do not check for back slashes before certain characters like (). This could be fixed by adding a helper method that modifies the link if neccissary and returns it. This helper method would be called at the highlighted area with the input as the highlighted variable.
