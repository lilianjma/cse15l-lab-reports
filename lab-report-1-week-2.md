# Important Terminal Commands

 Note: depending on your computer, the start of a new comman will be "$" or for me it is "\%". I will just be using "\$" to depict when a new command starts.

## Command 1: $ls

Typing in `$ls` will create a list of the all the files in the directory besides the hidden files that start with "." as shown below.

## Command 2: $ls -a

Typing in `$ls -a` will create a list of the all the files in the directory including the files that start with "." as shown below.

## Command 3: $cd

Typing in `$cd ` and then the name of a directory will move you to that directory. In the screenshot below, I have a folder called "UCSD" so when I use the command `$cd UCSD`, I am moved into that directory and can then access the other directories and files in UCSD. As you can see, next to the cruiser in the terminal, it says "lilian@Lilians-MackBook-Pro UCSD %" instead of what it had before, which was "lilian@Lilians-MackBook-Pro ~ %" showing that I moved from the root directory, denoted by the "~" into a directory in it called "UCSD".

## Command 4: $cd ..

Typing in `$cd ..` move you from your current directory into its parent directory. As seen below, I was in the "UCSD" directory and then after using the command I moved into its parent directory which also happened to be the root directory.
